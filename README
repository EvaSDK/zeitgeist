The Zeitgeist Engine
--------------------

Zeitgeist is a service that logs the users activity. The log can be queried
and managed in various ways over a DBus API.

Note that this package only contains the daemon, which you can use
together with several different user interfaces. If you don't know
which to use, try out https://launchpad.net/gnome-zeitgeist/.
