==============================================
Notes for contributing to the Zeitgeist engine
==============================================

Coding style
************

In general, follow PEP 8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>.
Especially try to keep the lines shorter than 80 characters. We are also
using TAB for indention.

Zeitgeist supports Python 2.5 and later.


Testing
*******

Before each commit to lp:zeitgeist the commiter must make sure that our
testsuite in test/ is running successfully.
We aim to get as much code tested as possible. New features and bug fixes
should get doc or unittests.


Documentation
*************

Our public API (code in zeitgeist/) must be fully documented. Code in
_zeitgeist/ is private code and should be documented and written in a
way so that others can understand it.


Changes to the public (DBus) API
********************************

changes to the public API are only possible in a major release series.


Code Review
***********

We are using launchpad's 'merge proposal' feature for our code review
process. Significant changes must have at least one positive vote from
one of the core developers (members of <http://launchpad.net/~zeitgeist>)


Release Tasks
*************
1. Bump version number to $VERSION in configure.ac and VERSION files

2. Update NEWS file by hand
  (hint: you can see the full change log with 'bzr log -n0 -v | less')
  
3. Commit your changes (with only these changes!) and push you current branch
   to lp:zeitgeist and lp:~zeitgeist/zeitgeist/zeitgeist-$VERSION
   
4. To make sure you have a pristine source tree do a clean checkout of the
   newly created branch:
   
     bzr branch lp:~zeitgeist/zeitgeist/zeitgeist-$VERSION
     
5. Change working dir to your new branch

6. Run './autogen.sh && make && make distcheck'

7. GPG sign the generated tarball with the command:

     gpg --armor --sign --detach-sig zeitgeist-$VERSION.tar.gz

8. Upload the tarball and the generated *.asc GPG signature to the right
   milestone on Launchpad
   
9. Send announcement email to the mailing lists:

    + zeitgeist@lists.launchpad.net
    + gnome-zeitgeist-users@lists.launchpad.net
    + gnome-announce-list@gnome.org
    
10. Post a news update on the Launchpad project page based on your
   announcement email

11. Make sure that the API documentation on zeitgeist-project.com is updated

12. Now you deserve a treat!
