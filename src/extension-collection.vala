     * Base class for all extensions
     *
     * FIXME: figure out what to do with this. I don't really see
     *        what the point for it is, since D-Bus accessible stuff is
     *        usually exported on a new interface. --RainCT
     * Every extension has to define a list of accessible methods as
     * 'PUBLIC_METHODS'. The constructor of an Extension object takes the
     * engine object it extends as the only argument.
     * ---
     *
     * In addition each extension has a set of hooks to control how events are
     * inserted and retrieved from the log. These hooks can either block the
     * event completely, modify it, or add additional metadata to it.
