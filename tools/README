This directory contains little utilities related to Zeitgeist.

Distributors
-------------------

Be aware that those utilities may have a different license than the main
Zeitgeist engine (for example, GPLv3+ instead of LGPLv3+).

Also, common sense is expected when it comes to their packaging; utilities
using graphical toolkits should most likely be split into a separate binary
package, as to not force unnecessary dependencies on the engine package.
