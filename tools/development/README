# USAGE
#
# To run the benchmarks on a certain branch of zeitgeist make sure you are
# running and instance of the branch. Make sure the branch includes the benchmark
# extension.
# 
# To benchmark and output timing to 'output.json' run
#  ./query_timings.py -o output.json
# If you already have data in the output file and want to merge both
# data sets (build avg.) run
#  ./query_timings.py -m -o output.json
# To plot the data use the '--plot' argument, multible '--plot' arguments
# When plotting one needs to choose between several types of plots such using 
# --type with arguments marsh_time, get_events_time, find_ids_time, find_events, overall)
#
# will define multible series.
#  ./query_timings.py --plot output.json --plot output1.json -o plot.svg
# In short, a run always looks like:
#  tools/development/query_timings.py --name "lp:zeitgeist" -o trunk.json \
#       --queries tools/development/query_sets/timerange_always.txt
#  tools/development/query_timings.py --name "lp:some-branch" -o somebranch.json \
#       --queries tools/development/query_sets/timerange_always.txt
#  tools/development/query_timings.py --plot --type marsh_time somebranch.json --plot trunk.json -o benchmark.svg
