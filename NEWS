Engine:

 - Fixed exception in DeleteEvents.
 - Added MostPopularActor, LeastPopularActor and MostRecentActor as possible
   ReturnTypes for FindEvents/FindEventsId (LP: #493903).

Python API:
 - Made the Interpretation and Manifestation classes iterable.
 - Added symbol lookup by URI, in the form of dictionary access.
 - Fixed the display name for Interpretation.SOURCECODE.

Overall:
 - More little fixes (LP: #510761) and cleanup.
 - Manpage updates.

2010-01-19: Zeitgeist 0.3.2
---------------------------

This release brings some nice little stuff and is used to power the first
release of the GNOME Activity Journal.

Engine:

 - Added FindEvents, optimized shorthand for GetEvents(FindEventIds(...)).
 - Fixed DeleteEvents and make it ignore bad requests.
 - Fixed GetEvents not to raise an exception when called with an empty list.

Python API:
 - ZeitgeistClient.get_version() now returns a Python list.

Overall:
 - Some code refactoring, documentation changes and other little fixes.

2010-01-10: Zeitgeist 0.3.1
---------------------------

Second development release leading up to the stable 0.4 series.

Engine:

 - Added a FindRelatedUris() method, to find URIs that often occur in relation
   to a given set of events. [Experimental]
 - Added a Blacklist API for block events from entering the log.
 - Added a fine-grained monitoring system for listening for updates to the log.
 - InsertEvents() now return an event id of 0 for events that are blocked
   or otherwise fail insertion.
 - Extensions can now provide hooks to block or change events before they
   are inserted into the log.
 - Removed support for more than one backend. What was known as the
   "Resonance backend" is now just "the engine".
 - Removed the GetLastTimestampForActor method.
 - Bugfix: You may now request more than 999 events in one go from GetEvents()
 - Bugfix: In find_eventids where using more than one event template resulted
   in all but the first one ignoring the timestamp restriction

Python API:

 - Bugfix: Fix URL of Interpretation.APPLICATION to correct Nepomuk URI.

Overall:

 - Added many new unit tests.
 - Overhauled and restructured the Sphinx-based API-documentation system. Now
   enumerations and the Manifestation and Interpreation classes are documented
   automatically.
 - Added bash-completion for zeitgeist-daemon.
 - More bugfixes and code style cleanups.

2009-12-01: Zeitgeist 0.3.0
------------------------------

First development release leading up to the stable 0.4 series. This release
is a complete rework of Zeitgeist and applications written for 0.2 won't work
without changes.

Engine:
 - Completely reworked the engine and DBus API.
 - Removed the Storm backend (obsoleted in 0.2.1) and the Querymancer backend.
 - Added support for extensions written in Python, with direct access to the
   database.

Python API:
 - Added a public Python client API split into two modules, zeitgeist.datamodel
   and zeitgeist.client.
 - Changed ontologies from XESAM to Nepomuk.

There are a few DISCLAIMERS that needs to be attached to this:

 - The event notifications/signals are not yet ready in the new DBus API.
   We expect to have that ready for 0.3.1.
 - We plan to support querying only for available items (eg. filtering out
   deleted files, not listing files on detached USB storage, etc.). However this
   feature is not fully supported yet, even though it is exposed in the API.
 - While we are pretty satisfied with the database layout, there may still be
   changes in the ontologies or concrete data extraction methods. This might
   require that users delete their log databases in order to rebuild them
   with the new definitions. Of course this will no longer happen when we
   go stable.
 - Much related to the point above our event ontologies are not yet set in
   stone, and minor changes are expected.
 - We have only one data-source enabled for now. Namely the one monitoring your
   recent files. In coming releases, application specific plugins will provide
   enhaced logging.
 - And finally, please note that this is a *development release*. We can not
   guarantee stability of services nor APIs, although we strive hard to keep
   things stable.

Version 0.2.1
------------------------------

This version's D-Bus API and database is completely backwards-compatible with
version 0.2, and it focuses on compatibility and performance enhancements.

 - Added compatibility with Python version 2.5.
 - Removed the Storm dependency, obtaining general performance improvements.
 - Removed the need for a patched PyGTK.
 - Made the GtkRecentlyUser logger more robust (fixes an infinit loop on some
   systems).
 - Improved performance of DeleteItems and UpdateItems.
 - Fixed a problem with the contents of the EventsChanged signal.
 - Fixed InsertEvents to enforce "mimetype" as a required value.
 - Fixed a bug where the sorting_asc=True in FindEvents would be ignored if
   used together with mode="mostused" (LP: #404947).
 - Highly improved caching.
 - Added a "--quit" option to zeitgeist-daemon to stop any running daemon.
 - General code improvements, new test cases and other minor fixes.

Version 0.2
------------------------------

Initial release, because we are that cool :).
