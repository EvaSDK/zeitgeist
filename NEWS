2010-01-19: Zeitgeist 0.3.2
---------------------------

This release brings some nice little stuff and is used to power the first
release of the GNOME Activity Journal.

 * Add FindEvents, optimized shorthand for GetEvents(FindEventIds(...)).
 * Fix DeleteEvents and make it ignore bad requests.
 * Fix GetEvents not to raise an exception when called with an empty list.
 * ZeitgeistClient.get_version() now returns a Python list.
 * Some code refactoring, documentation changes and other little fixes.

2010-01-10: Zeitgeist 0.3.1
---------------------------

Second development release leading up to the stable 0.4 series.

 * Add a FindRelatedUris() method to the core DBus API (also to the Python
   client lib). This can be used to find URIs that occur in relation to
   a set of events, sorted by relevancy. Please note that FindRelatedUris()
   is still marked as experimental and we can not guarantee stability yet
 * The Zeitgeist engine now exposes a Blacklist API over DBus which can be
   used to block events from entering the log
 * The engine now also exposes a fine grained monitoring system that can be
   used to listen for updates to the log
 * InsertEvents() now return an event id of 0 for events that are blocked
   or otherwise fail insertion
 * Extensions can now provide hooks to block or change events before they
   are inserted into the log
 * Remove support for more than one backend. What was known as the
   "Resonance backend" is now just "the engine"
 * Removed method from DBus API GetLastTimestampForActor
 * Lots more unit tests added
 * The engine will now load a default set of extensions on startup
 * Overhaul and restructure our Sphinx-based API-documentation system. This
   has facilitated automagic documentation of our enumerations and Manifestation
   and Interpretation classes
 * API documentation is more or less at 100% both for the DBus API and
   the Python client library
 * Bash completion for zeitgeist-daemon
 * Bugfix: You may now request more than 999 events in one go from GetEvents()
 * Bugfix: In find_eventids where using more than one event template resulted
   in all but the first one ignoring the timestamp restriction
 * Bugfix: Fix URL of Interpretation.APPLICATION to correct Nepomuk URI
 * More bugfixes and code style cleanups

2009-12-01: Zeitgeist 0.3.0
------------------------------

First development release leading up to the stable 0.4 series. This release
features:

 - Complete rework of engine and DBus API. Read: apps written against 0.2.*
   will most certainly need an update (see fx.
   http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2009-November/msg00019.html)
 - Public Python client API defined in zeitgeist.datamodel and
   zeitgeist.client modules
 - Documented public API with Sphinx (we'll have an URL for you shortly)
 - Changed Ontology from XESAM to Nepomuk.
 - Removed the Storm backend (obsoleted in 0.2.1).
 - Removed the Querymancer backend.
 - Support for event payloads (binary attachments to events)
 - An extension API for the core engine, allowing extensions direct access to the DB
   There are already a handful extensions things in the works here, you will hear
   more about this later

There are a few DISCLAIMERS that needs to be attached to this:

 - The event notification/signals are not yet ready in the new DBus API.
   We expect to have that ready for 0.3.1.
 - We plan to support querying only for available items (eg. filtering out
   deleted files, not listing files on detached USB storage, etc.). However this
   feature is not fully supported yet, even though it is exposed in the API.
 - While we are pretty satisfied with the database layout, there may still be
   changes in the ontologies or concrete data extraction methods. This might
   require that users delete their log databases in order to rebuild them
   with the new definitions. Of course this will no longer happen when we
   go stable
 - Much related to the point above our event ontologies are not yet set in stone,
   and minor changes are expected
 - We have only one logger enabled for now. Namely the one monitoring your
   recent files. In coming releases this logger may well be deprecated in favour
   of application specific plugins.
 - And finally. Please note that this is a *development release*. We can not
   guarantee stability of services nor APIs, although we strive hard to keep
   things stable.

Version 0.2.1
------------------------------

This version's D-Bus API and database is completely backwards-compatible with
version 0.2, and it focuses on compatibility and performance enhancements.

 - Added compatibility with Python version 2.5.
 - Removed the Storm dependency, obtaining general performance improvements.
 - Removed the need for a patched PyGTK.
 - Made the GtkRecentlyUser logger more robust (fixes an infinit loop on some
   systems).
 - Improved performance of DeleteItems and UpdateItems.
 - Fixed a problem with the contents of the EventsChanged signal.
 - Fixed InsertEvents to enforce "mimetype" as a required value.
 - Fixed a bug where the sorting_asc=True in FindEvents would be ignored if
   used together with mode="mostused" (LP: #404947).
 - Highly improved caching.
 - Added a "--quit" option to zeitgeist-daemon to stop any running daemon.
 - General code improvements, new test cases and other minor fixes.


Version 0.2
------------------------------

Initial release, because we are that cool :).
