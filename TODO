- Finish EventsChanged in remote.py
- Review FocusDurationRegister code,found a lot of naming conventions errors and some minor bugs.
- Fix the tables to use FLOATS for timestamps instead of INTERGERs (this will affect the code in the engine)
- Fix the RecentlyUsed provider
- Test all Relevancy stuff
- Add a WNCK monitor to inform us with window focus changes. This module should land into the loggers.

Stuff worth considering:
 - Log package installations/removals/updates.
 - Use Pylint / pyflakes to keep the code clean.
