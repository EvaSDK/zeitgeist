TODO:

- Backend:
	+ Move all GUI-related code out of zeitgeist_base.py.
	+ Move all Twitter/Firefox/Tomboy specific code out of zeitgeist_base.py
		and into the appropriate subclasses.
	+ Add on Tracker support.

- Frontend:
	+ Modify the GUI so that it looks more like GMail.
	+ Add on support for switching between a GMail-style list of 
		items and a grid of item thumbnails.
	+ After the new database design is finished, query the database 
		for all searches instead of just searching the cache.
