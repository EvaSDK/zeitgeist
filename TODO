TODO
================================

FOR RELEASE:
-------------------

 - Fix the auto-start from the .service file.
 - Fix all milestoned Launchpad bugs.
 - The tray icon should start the daemon, instead of the other way
   around.
 - Ensure that the datahub ends when the daemon dies.
 - Ensure that everything works correctly and a .deb can be created.

FUTURE:
------------

- Backend:
	+ Add on Tracker support.
	+ Extend DB to support location of usage
	+ Related Items should be automatically determined by currently used URI.
	+ Auto Tagging e.g: tasks, locations, and relations.

- Frontend:
	+ Do not show an item twice one beneath the other.
	+ create a bar displaying the related files to currently opened files (inspired by Gimmie)
