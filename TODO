TODO:

FOR RELEASE:

- Backend:
	+ Move all GUI-related code out of zeitgeist_base.py.
	+ Move all Twitter/Firefox/Tomboy specific code out of zeitgeist_base.py (Done?)
		and into the appropriate subclasses.
	+ Export all DataProviders outside the zeitgeist_engine into a new plugin package,
	that communicates with the engine via D-Bus

- Frontend:
	+ Use a generic CellRenderer to display stars for bookmarking instead of checkboxes!
	+ Stop instantiating widgets in zeitgeist_widgets.py (see the last 7 lines). This wastes memory
	  and processing for widgets, even when we don't display them.



FUTURE:

- Backend:
	+ Add on Tracker support.
	+ Extend DB to support location of usage
	+ Related Items should be automatically determined by currently used URI.
	+ Auto Tagging e.g: tasks, locations, and relations.

- Frontend:
	+ Do not show an item twice one beneath the other.
	+ create a bar displaying the related files to currently opened files (inspired by Gimmie)
