TODO:

- Backend:
	+ Move all GUI-related code out of zeitgeist_base.py.
	+ Move all Twitter/Firefox/Tomboy specific code out of zeitgeist_base.py (Done?)
		and into the appropriate subclasses.
	+ Add on Tracker support.
	+ Set relationships between Data based on: 
		1. Other Items usage in the periods where the Data.
		2. Common Tags.
		3. Context (example context of text files).
	+ Extend DB to support location of usage
	+ Related Items should be automatically determined by currently used URI.
	+ Auto Tagging e.g: tasks, locations, and relations.
	+ Finish the D-Bus interface. (We need to insert items via DBUS , maybe patch up the datasink to have an insert in string tuples)
	+ Reduce the amount of "changed" signals send.
	+ Fix the firefox DB detection (see comment in code).
	+ Is RecentlyUsedDocuments the best place for text/plain files?

- Frontend:
    + Separate it from the backend and let it only use D-Bus for communication.
	+ Do not show an item twice one beneath the other.
	+ Use a generic CellRenderer to display stars for bookmarking instead of checkboxes!
	+ create a bar displaying the related files to currently opened files (inspired by Gimmie)
