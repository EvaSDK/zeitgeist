What needs to be done before this branch can be merged into lp:zeitgeist?
=========================================================================

Other stuff
***********

    * API changes, need to be documented:
      - Symbol names are now UserActivity instead of USER_ACTIVITY
      - OPEN_EVENT became AccessEvent, and so on. (LP: #489262)
      - calling random attribute on a symbol does not auto-create a new symbol
      
    * {nao, nie}.py are empty, which symbols do we need from this onto?
      
    * describe new features:
      - symbol hirarchy
      
    * describe known issues:
      - symbol names might not be unique
      
    * missing symbols:
      - Interpretation.UNKNOWN (or is this covered by just 'Interpretation'?)
      - Manifestation.WEB_HISTORY
      
    * do we need a script/hook to convert the users db to the new symbols?
      
    * Is our collection of symbols complete, do we miss some, if so, which?
      
    * i18n of Symbol attributes (optional):
      How do we support this, on python level, or is it possible in the ontology itself?
      
    * beautify sphinx docs of the ontology (optional):
      Is there a better way to document the symbols in a more structured way, like linking parents and childrens
