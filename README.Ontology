What needs to be done before this branch can be merged into lp:zeitgeist?
=========================================================================

Failing testcases
*****************
    * datamodel-test: SymbolCollectionTest.testConstruct
      TODO: how do we support dynamic creation of symbols?
    
    

Other stuff
***********

    * API changes, need to be documented:
      - Symbol names are now UserActivity instead of USER_ACTIVITY
      - OPEN_EVENT became AccessEvent, and so on.
      
    * describe new features:
      - symbol hirarchy
      
    * describe known issues:
      - symbol names might not be unique
      
    * do we need a script/hook to convert the users db to the new symbols?
      
    * Is our collection of symbols complete, do we miss some, if so, which?
      
    * i18n of Symbol attributes (optional):
      How do we support this, on python level, or is it possible in the ontology itself?
      
    * beautify sphinx docs of the ontology (optional):
      Is there a better way to document the symbols in a more structured way, like linking parents and childrens
