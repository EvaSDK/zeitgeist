= Gnome Zeitgeist - user documentation =

== What is this document? ==
This is user documentation, i.e. what can you as a user do with Gnome Zeigeist. It is not intended to give you a technical overview of what happens inside the application. For that, refer to the developer documents.

== What does Gnome Zeitgeist do? ==
Gnome Zeitgeist (GZG) is an application that tries to keep track of your workflow. It does so by keeping your web browsing history, your document history, image history, etc. all together.

If you are like most people in front of a computer, you do a variety of tasks, that are not done in the same application (program). E.g. you work on your documents, while browsing the web for sources, while chatting online with your colleague, and sending mails to your boss about the fantastic progress you're making. All of a sudden you have to do something completely different for a couple of days, and your nice train of thought is lost. When you restart, you need to piece back all those small parts to put you back on track.
Wouldn't it be nice if there was somewhere you could turn to bring up all the different pieces of information that were necessary to restart your work? 
Well, there is. GZG will do that for you.

== What you see on startup ==
When you start GZG you don't see much at all, except a small magnifying glass slash clock in your system tray (aka. notification area). That is the visible evidence that your daemon is running. [what the hell's a daemon] Click the GZG icon, and a window opens. This is your Journal. [Add image]

You also have some other options from this icon: Right click and you'll be able to open Project Viewer and Timeline.

== Using the [Journal] ==
The journal has a main area, which is your timeline, each day separated. Each day has different items of your history, each with a fitting icon, so you can tell what it is (web history, document, etc).

If you look in the top part of your journal window, you'll see some buttons, we'll discuss these first.

=== Back, forth and home buttons [images] ===
These are the buttons that bring you back (<-) and forth (->) in your timeline. The [home button] will bring you to your current date.

There is another way of going back in time, if you need to jump far. See [Link to Calendar button] for that.

The other buttons are toggles, meaning they are pressed or not.

=== The Bookmark button [image] ===
Clicking the bookmark button will open up a sidebar on the left side of the Journal window. This is where stuff you use GZG to bookmark will show up. This hasn't got anythin to do with your browser bookmarks, so changing the bookmarks in the browser won't change what appears here, and bookmarking items in GZG will not affect your browser bookmarks.

The bookmarks sidebar is good for keeping things that you need to have fast access to.

When you bookmark one item, all instances of this item gets bookmarked.

If there is nothing in this window, that's because you haven't used it yet. You can add and remove bookmarks in several ways:

. By checking the boxes next to the items

. By dragging and dropping (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)

.. You can drag and drop items onto the bookmark button (adding)

.. You can drag and drop items onto the bookmarks sidebar (adding), or dragging them out and dropping them anywhere else (removing)

. By right-clicking an item and choose "Bookmark"

=== The Tag button [image] ===
Clicking the tag button will bring in an area on the bottom of the window. 

Tagging is great for easy sorting stuff that relates to work, private, family, etc. You can use as many tags as you'd like.

To the far left of this area you'll see a small drop down box. You can choose between "Recently used tags" and "Most used tags". 

Next to that drop down box there are buttons with possible tags corresponding to what is chosen in the drop down box. By default the buttons are the names of the directories (often called folders) that your items belong to. That is because we tend to sort things in directories or folders, so it's a pretty intuitive start. When you start making your own tags, they will also be included in this area after having been used a little.

There are several ways to add or remove tags to your items:

. By dragging and dropping the buttons to the item (don't worry, they won't disappear drom the bottom part of the window)

. By right-clicking and choosing "Edit tags". Choosing this will open a new window. In this window you add and remove tags in two ways:

.. Manually enter the name of a tag. Separate tags by using a comma (,). Removing these tags is done by just removing what you wrote.

.. Click a tag button to add it. You'll see the button looks pressed. Click it once more to remove the tag.


==== Viewing your tags ====
You can view your tags in several ways:

. If you let your cursor hover over an item, you'll see that the tags for that item are put in the bottom of the box that shows.

. Using the input box on the right side of the main Journal window, you can write in the name (or part of the name) of a tag, and the main area of the journal viewer will show only those items that match by tag or name.

. Using Filters, see [The Filters button]

=== The Filters button [image] ===
Clicking the Filters button will open a sidebar on the right side of the Journal window. This is where you choose what GZG wil keep in its history. If you want to turn off logging of something, this is the place. Categories that are not checked will not be appearing as items.

There is also a filter view here (NOT IMPLEMENTED)

There is also two other buttons here (DOES NOT BELONG THERE)

. Create new note:
This will open a new note in Tomboy, a note taking application. Think of these notes as small Post-its that you write in things you need to remember. Of course, GZG will log these notes, if you have Notes checked in the Filters sidebar

. Create new document:
This will make a new text document in your preferred text editor. (Note that a text editor is not the same as a word processor.)


=== The Calendar button [image] ===
Clicking the calendar button will bring in another piece in the sidebar on the right side of the Journal window. This is a calendar, and you can pick a date to move your starting point to a particular date.

=== The input box ===
In the top right corner of the Journal window is the input box that we discussed in [Viewing your tags]

=== Related items ===
If you've followed this guide, you'll have seen that there is a right-click option that we haven't talked about. It is the "Shwo related items" [currently called "...files", should be changed] option. Choosing this will open a new window that lists items that could be related to the item you're looking at. This is based on what items were used at the same time, and if that usually happens. So, it is prone to mistakes, because it will also contain not related items that you just often happen to use at the same time.

== Using the [Project Viewer] ==
Add some stuff...

== Using the [Timeline] ==
Add some stuff...
