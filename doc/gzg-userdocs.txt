= GNOME Zeitgeist: User documentation =

== What is this document? ==
This is user documentation, i.e. what can you as a user do with Gnome Zeigeist. It is not intended to give you a technical overview of what happens inside the application. For that, refer to the developer documents.

== What does Gnome Zeitgeist do? ==
Gnome Zeitgeist (GZG) is an application that tries to keep track of your workflow. It does so by keeping your web browsing history, your document history, image history, etc. all together.

If you are like most people in front of a computer, you do a variety of tasks, that are not done in the same application (program). E.g. you work on your documents, while browsing the web for sources, while chatting online with your colleague, and sending emails to your boss about the fantastic progress you're making. All of a sudden you have to do something completely different for a couple of days, and your nice train of thought is lost. When you restart, you need to piece back all those small parts to put you back on track.
Wouldn't it be nice if there was somewhere you could turn to bring up all the different pieces of information that were necessary to restart your work? 
Well, there is. GZG will do that for you.

== What you see on startup ==
When you start GZG you see a small icon in your system tray (commonly also called "notification area"). This is the GZG daemon running. A daemon is a computer program that runs in the background, rather than under the direct control of a user; they are usually initiated as background processes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computer_software)

Open GZG journal:
Click the GZG icon or right click and click open Journal. 



== Using the Journal ==
The journal has a main area, which is your timeline. You can open the activities displayed here. Each day and each different activity type are separated. The activities are web history, documents, music etc.

Next to the timeline are left and right buttons 
These are the buttons that bring you back, and forward in your timeline.
There is another way of going back in timeline, if you need to jump far. See [Link to Calendar button] for that.

On the left side of your journal window, you'll see some buttons.
These are the search, Favourite and the home buttons.

If you right click on an item in the journal you will get more options.
These options are open, bookmark, show related activities, edit tags and delete from Zeitgeist.

=== The Search button ===
Clicking this button will open a sidebar that contains filters and date view and the search. 

The calendar section:
This is a calendar, and you can pick a date to move your starting point to a particular date. If you single click the journal shows the day you select and also the two days before the selected date. If you double click the journal shows only the date selected.

The activity filters section:
This section contains the different activity types. If an activity is not checked that type of activity will not be appear in the journal.

The search tab:
This tab contains a search bar and a filter containing the most recently used tags. You can search by the name of the file and the files tag. Beside the search box is a clean up button to clear the box. The recent tags filter, filters the items in the journal using tags. If you click on the tag it filters using that tag, if you click it again it deselects that filter.

=== The Favourite button ===
The Bookmarks tab is empty the first time you run GZG. This will contain the items that you have chosen to have fast access to. The star image:images/22/bookmark-new-grey.png[] next to all items is a checkable button. It will light up when checked: image:images/22/bookmark-new.png[]

Note that GZG bookmarks doesn't have anything to do with the bookmarks in your web browser. Adding or deleting bookmarks in one, will not change anything in the other.

== The Bookmark ==
Items that are bookmarked will go into the bookmarked tab. When you bookmark one item, all instances of this item gets bookmarked.

Checking the star next to an item bookmarks it, you can star an item by right clicking on an item and choose By right-clicking an item and choose "Bookmark".

Removing the star is done by the same ways: Right click the item, and choose "Unbookmark", or click the highlighted star.

=== Editing tags ===
Clicking the tag button image:images/22/tag.png[] will bring in a sidebar to the left of the window. 

Tagging is great for easy sorting stuff that relates to work, private, family, etc. You can use as many tags as you'd like.

At the top of this sidebar you'll see a small drop down box. You can choose between "Recently used tags" and "Most used tags". 

Below the drop down box there are buttons with possible tags corresponding to what is chosen in the drop down box. By default the buttons are the names of the directories (often called folders) that your items belong to. That is because we tend to sort things in directories or folders, so it's a pretty intuitive start. When you start making your own tags, they will also be included in this area after having been used a little.

There are several ways to add or remove tags to your items:

. By dragging and dropping the buttons to the item

. By right-clicking and choosing "Edit tags". Choosing this will open a new window. In this window you add and remove tags in two ways:

.. Manually enter the name of a tag. Separate tags by using a comma (,). Removing these tags is done by just removing what you wrote.

.. Click a tag button to add it. You'll see the button looks pressed. Click it once more to remove the tag.

=== Related items ===
Moving down the right-click option menu, we have the "Show related items" option. Choosing this will open a new window that lists items that could be related to the item you're looking at. This is based on what items were used at the same time, and if that usually happens. So, it is prone to mistakes, because it will also contain not related items that you just often happen to use at the same time.

=== Removing items from Zeitgeist ===
Sometimes you'll want to delete items from Zeitgeist due to various reasons. It may be crowding the window, because you always open that web page, or it might be something that you'd rather not want anyone else using your computer to see in your history. You can then use the right click menu on that item and choose to delete it from Zeitgeist.

[NOTE]
===============================
Choose carefully when you remove stuff from Zeitgeist. It might just happen that you'll need that item later on.

For example, it might seem like a good idea to leave all your Gmail conversations out of Zeitgeist, but what happens when you need to track down that particular conversation that includes the source of what you were working on?
