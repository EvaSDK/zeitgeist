\fBzeitgeist\-daemon\fP \fI[OPTION]\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBzeitgeist\-daemon\fP is a daemon which keeps track of activities
on your system (file usage, browser history, calendar events, etc.)
and logs them into a central database. It does not only create a
chronologic register, but also supports tagging and can establish
relationships between activities.

All this information is provided by external applications which
communicate with \fBzeitgeist\-daemon\fP over D-Bus. Interested
programs can connect with it and request information, insert new
items or modify existing information (delete items, add tags,
bookmark items and so on).

By default, \fBzeitgeist\-daemon\fP will also start the bundled
logging application \fBzeitgeist\-datahub\fP.

options starting with two dashes (`--'). A summary of options is
included below.
