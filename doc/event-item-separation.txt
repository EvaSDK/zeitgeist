	"source": string,  #TODO: description
	"content": string, #TODO: description, # previously "use"
	
An event can also have this optional attributes:

	"uri": string, #TODO: why is it there at all? the reference implementation of the engine creates an uri on runtime and does not use any uri given here

	"tags": list of strings, tags which have been associated with this event
	"bookmark": boolean, is this a bookmarked event?
