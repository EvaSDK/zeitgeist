.TH ZEITGEIST\-JOURNAL 1 "May 20, 2009" "GNOME Zeitgeist"

.SH NAME
zeitgeist\-journal \- graphical application to browse through logged activities

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBzeitgeist\-journal\fP \fI[OPTION]\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
GNOME Zeitgeist is a tool for easily browsing and finding files and
other activities on your computer. It keeps a chronological journal
of all your file activity, browser history and other relevant data, and
includes support for tagging and establishing relationships between
activities.
.PP
\fBzeitgeist\-journal\fP is the graphical component of GNOME Zeitgeist.
It communicates with the main engine (which runs in the background) and
provides a GTK interface to explore the logged activities journal.
.PP
Note that GNOME Zeitgeist is heavily based upon D-Bus. Because of this,
all sorts of applications can integrate with D-Bus (be it as graphical
interfaces for all or a subset of its features, as data sources
providing logging capabilities, or as both). \fBzeitgeist\-journal\fP
is the default interface developed by the project, but anyone is free
to create alternative applications and you may even use several at once.

.SH OPTIONS
